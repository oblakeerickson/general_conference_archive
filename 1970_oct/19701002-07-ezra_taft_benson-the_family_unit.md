# The Family Unit
#### October 2, 1970
## Elder Ezra Taft Benson
*Of the Council of the Twelve*

As a people, we have three great loyalties: loyalty to God, loyalty to family, loyalty to country. I come to you today with a plea to strengthen our families.

### The family unit

It has been truly stated that "salvation is a family affair . . . and that the family unit is the most important organization in time or in eternity."

The Church was created in large measure to help the family, and long after the Church has performed its mission, the celestial patriarchal order will still be functioning. This is why President Joseph F. Smith said: "To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman . . . ," and President McKay added: "When one puts business or pleasure above his home, he, that moment, starts on the downgrade to soul weakness."

And this is why President Harold B. Lee said only yesterday, "The Church must do more to help the home carry out its divine mission."

### Temptations and pitfalls

President Joseph Fielding Smith has stated that never "in the history of the Church have there been so many temptations, so many pitfalls, so many dangers, to lure away the members of the Church from the path of duty and from righteousness as we find today." (Take Heed to Yourselves, p. 127.)

And he has also said: "This world is not growing better . . . wickedness is increasing." (Ibid., p. 207.)

Never has the devil been so well organized, and never in our day has he had so many powerful emissaries working for him. We must do everything in our power to strengthen and safeguard the home and family.

The adversary knows "that the home is the first and most effective place for children to learn the lessons of life: truth, honor, virtue, self-control; the value of education, honest work, and the purpose and privilege of life. Nothing can take the place of home in rearing and teaching children, and no
other success can compensate for failure in the home." (President David O. McKay, in Family Home Evening Manual, 1968-69, p. iii.)

### Undermining of home

And so today, the undermining of the home and family is on the increase, with the devil anxiously working to displace the father as the head of the home and create rebellion among the children. The Book of Mormon describes this condition when it states,

"And my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them." And then these words follow—and consider these words seriously when you think of those political leaders who are promoting birth control and abortion: "O my people, they who lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths." (2 Ne. 13:12.) And let me warn the sisters in all seriousness that you who submit yourselves to an abortion or to an operation that precludes you from safely having additional healthy children are jeopardizing your exaltation and your future membership in the kingdom of God.

### Responsibility of parents

Parents are directly responsible for the righteous rearing of their children, and this responsibility cannot be safely delegated to relatives, friends, neighbors, the school, the church, or the state.

"I appeal to you parents, take nothing for granted about your children," said President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.

"The great bulk of them, of course, are good, but some of us do not know when they begin to go away from the path of truth and righteousness. Be watchful every day and hour. Never relax your care, your solicitude. Rule kindly in the spirit of the Gospel and the spirit of the priesthood, but rule, if you wish your children to follow the right path."

Permissive parents are part of the problem.

### False educational ideas

As a watchman on the tower, I feel to warn you that one of the chief means of misleading our youth and destroying the family unit is our educational institutions. President Joseph F. Smith referred to false educational ideas as one of the three threatening

dangers among our Church members.

There is more than one reason why

the Church is advising our youth to

attend colleges close to their homes

where institutes of religion are available. It gives the parents the opportunity to stay close to their children;

and if they have become alert and

informed as President McKay admonished us last year, these parents can

help expose some of the deceptions of

men like Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin, John Dewey, Karl Marx, John

Keynes, and others.

Today there are much worse things

that can happen to a child than not

getting a full college education. In

fact, some of the worst things have

happened to our children while attending colleges led by administrators who

wink at subversion and amorality.

Said Karl G. Maeser, "I would rather

have my child exposed to smallpox,

typhus fever, cholera, or other malignant and deadly diseases than to the

degrading influence of a corrupt

teacher. It is infinitely better to take

chances with an ignorant, but pureminded teacher than with the greatest

philosopher who is impure."

Vocational education, correspondence

courses, establishment in a family

business are being considered for their

children by an increasing number of

parents.

Propagation of atheism

The tenth plank in Karl Marx's

Manifesto for destroying our kind of

civilization advocated the establishment of "free education for all children

in public schools." There were sev-

eral reasons why Marx wanted government to run the schools. Dr. A. A.

Hodge pointed out one of them when

he said, "It is capable of exact

demonstration that if every party in the

State has the right of excluding from

public schools whatever he does not

believe to be true, then he that believes

most must give way to him that believes least, and then he that believes

least must give way to him that

believes absolutely nothing, no matter

in how small a minority the atheists

or agnostics may be. It is self-evident

that on this scheme, if it is consistently

and persistently carried out in all parts

of the country, the United States system of national popular education will

be the most efficient and widespread

instrument for the propagation of

atheism which the world has ever

seen."

After the tragic prayer decision was

made by the Court, President David O.

McKay stated, "The Supreme Court of

the United States severs the connecting

cord between the public schools of the

United States and the source of divine

intelligence, the Creator, himself."

(Relief Society Magazine, December

1962, p. 878.)

Does that make any difference to

you? Can't you see why the demand

of conscientious parents is increasing

the number of private Christian and

Americanist oriented schools?

Today, Brigham Young University is

the largest private school in the United

States. Parents from far and near are

looking to Brigham Young University

as never before.

Supervision by parents

Now, whether your child attends this

type of school or not, it is important

that you stay close to your children,

daily review, if possible, what they

have learned in school, and go over

their textbooks.

President Joseph Fielding Smith has

stated that in public schools you cannot get a textbook, anywhere that he

knows of, on the "ologies" that doesn't

contain nonsense. (Take Heed to Yourselves, p. 32.)

I know one noble father who reviews

with his children regularly what they

have been taught; and if they have

been taught any falsehoods, then the

children and the father together research out the truth. If your children

are required to put down on exams the

falsehoods that have been taught, then

perhaps they can follow President

Joseph Fielding Smith's counsel of

prefacing their answer with the words

"teacher says," or they might say "you

taught" or "the textbook states."

If your children are taught untruths

on evolution in the public schools or

even in our Church schools, provide

them with a copy of President Joseph

Fielding Smith's excellent rebuttal in

his book Man, His Origin and Destiny.

Open letter to school principal

Recently some parents paid for space

in a newspaper to run an open letter

to the school principal of their son.

The letter in part stated:

"You are hereby notified that our

son, , is not allowed by his

undersigned parents to participate in,

or be subject to instruction in, any

training or education in sex, human

biological development, attitude development, self-understanding, personal and family life, or group therapy, or

sensitivity training, or self-criticism, or

any combination or degree thereof,

without the consent of the undersigned

by express written permission. . . .

"We intend to retain and exercise

our parental rights to guide our child

in the areas of morality and sexual behavior without any interference or

contradiction imposed by school personnel.

"[Our son] has been taught to recognize the format of sensitivity training,

group therapy, self-criticism, etc., as it

is being broadly applied, lowering

the standards of morality and replacing American individual responsibility

with the dependency on, and conformity to, the 'herd consensus' concept

of collectivism.

"He has been instructed to promptly

remove himself from any class in

which he is exposed to the aforementioned indoctrination and to report to

us any such disregard of this letter."

Home evening program

The Lord knew that in the last days

Satan would try to destroy the family

unit. He knew that by court edict,

pornography would be allowed to

prosper.

How grateful we should be that God

inspired his prophet over half a century ago to institute the weekly home

evening program. This is the vanguard for getting parents to assume the

responsibility of instructing their

children. An increasing number of

faithful Saints are holding more than

one home evening a week and are

adding to or deleting from the home

evening manual as the Spirit dictates.

Designed to strengthen and safeguard the family, the Church home

evening program (one night each week)

is to be set apart for fathers and mothers to gather their sons and daughters

around them in the home. Prayer is

offered, hymns and other songs are

sung, scripture is read, family topics

are discussed, talent is displayed, principles of the gospel are taught, and

often games are played and homemade refreshments served.

Now here are the promised blessings

for those who will hold a weekly

home evening:

"If the Saints obey this counsel, we

promise that great blessings will result.

Love at home and obedience to parents

will increase. Faith will be developed

in the hearts of the youth of Israel,

and they will gain power to combat

the evil influences and temptations

which beset them." (First Presidency,

April 27, 1915, Improvement Era, vol.

18, p. 734.)

Demoralizing entertainment

Now what of the entertainment that

is available to our young people today?

Are you being undermined right in

your home through your TV, radio,

slick magazines, rock records? Much

of the rock music is purposely designed

to push immorality, narcotics, revolution, atheism, and nihilism, through

language that often has a double

meaning and with which many parents are not familiar.

Parents who are informed can warn

their children of the demoralizing,

loud, raucous beat of rock music, which

deadens the senses and dulls the sensibilities—the jungle rhythm which

inflames the savagery within.

Said President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.:

"I would have you reflect for a moment upon the fact that a tremendous

amount of the modern art, of the

modern literature and music, and the

drama that we have today is utterly

demoralizing—utterly. . . . Your music

—well, I do not know how far above

the tom-tom of the jungle it is, but

it is not too far. . . .

"These things you must watch. They

all have their effects on the children.

Make your homelife as near heavenlike as you can." (Relief Society Magazine, December 1952, p. 798.)

Holding aloft of standards

Youth leaders, are you holding aloft

our standards or have you compromised

them for the lowest common denominator in order to appease the deceived

or vile within the Church? Are the

dances and music in your cultural halls

virtuous, lovely, praiseworthy, and of

good report, or do they represent a

modern Sodom with short skirts, loud

beat, strobe lights, and darkness?

Will our youth leaders accept the

standards set for young John Wesley

by his mother? Hear her sound

counsel

:

"Would you judge of the lawfulness

or unlawfulness of pleasure? Take this

rule: Now note whatever weakens your

reason, impairs the tenderness of your

conscience, obscures your sense of God,

takes off your relish for spiritual things,

whatever increases the authority of the

body over the mind, that thing is sin

to you, however innocent it may seem

in itself."

Have we, as Moroni warned, "polluted the holy church of God?" (Morm.

8:38.) The auxiliaries of the Church

are to be a help, not a hindrance, to

parents and the priesthood as they

strive to lead their families back to

God. Do any of us wear or display the

broken cross, anti-Christ sign, that is

the adversary's symbol of the so-called

"peace movement"?

Lack of knowledge

"My people are destroyed for lack

of knowledge," lamented Hosea. (Hos.

4:6.) Today, because some parents

have refused to become informed and

then stand up and inform their children, they are witnessing the gradual

physical and spiritual destruction of

their posterity. If we would become

like God, knowing good and evil, then

we had best find out what is undermining us, how to avoid it, and what

we can do about it.

It is time that the hearts of us fathers

be turned to our children and the

hearts of the children be turned to us

fathers, or we shall both be cursed.

The seeds of divorce are often sown

and the blessings of children delayed

by wives working outside the home.

Working mothers should remember

that their children usually need more

of mother than of money.

Family solidarity

As conditions in the world get progressively worse, it is crucial that the

family draw closer together in righteousness and that family solidarity be

established. As one has said, "There

are too many pulls away from the

home today. We should seriously consider whether or not too many activities and other interests take too much

time and attention from our families,

from our children, from those whom

the Lord God gave us to love, to nourish, to teach, and to help through

life."

The stick-together families are happier

by far

Than the brothers and the sisters who

take separate highways are.

The gladdest people living are the

wholesome folks who make

A circle at the fireside that no power on

earth can break.

And the finest of conventions ever held

beneath the sun

Are the little family gatherings when

the busy day is done.

There are rich folk, there are poor folk,

who imagine they are wise.

And they're very quick to shatter all

the little family ties.

Each goes searching after pleasure in

his own selected way.

Each with strangers likes to wander,

and with strangers likes to play.

But it's bitterness they harvest, and it's

empty joy they find,

For the children that are wisest are the

stick-together kind.

There are some who seem to fancy

that for gladness they must roam,

That for smiles that are the brightest

they must wander far from home.

That the strange friend is the true

friend, and they travel far astray

And they waste their lives in striving

for a joy that's far away,

But the gladdest sort of people, when

the busy day is done,

Are the brothers and the sisters, who

together share their fun.

It's the stick-together family that wins

the joys of earth,

That hears the sweetest music and

that finds the finest mirth;

It's the old home roof that shelters all

the charm that life can give;

There you find the gladdest playground,

there the happiest spot to live.

And, O weary, wandering brother, if

contentment you would win,

Come you back unto the fireside and

be comrade with your kin.

(Adapted from a poem

by Edgar A. Guest.)

Strengthening the family

And so let's strengthen the family.

Family and individual prayer, morning

and evening, can invite the blessings of

the Lord on your household. Mealtime

provides a wonderful time to review

the activities of the day and to not only

feed the body, but to feed the spirit

as well, with members of the family

taking turns reading the scriptures,

particularly the Book of Mormon.

Nighttime is a great time for the busy

father to go to each child's bedside, to

talk with him, answer his questions,

and tell him how much he is loved.

In such homes there is no "generation

gap." This deceptive phrase is another

tool of the devil to weaken the home

and family. Children who honor their

parents and parents who love their

children can make a home a haven of

safety and a little bit of heaven.

Does this poem describe your family

gatherings?

We are all here:

Father, mother,

Sister, brother,

All who hold each other dear.

Each chair is filled, we are all at home.

Tonight, let no cold stranger come;

It must be often thus around

Our old familiar hearth we're found.

Bless, then, the meeting and the spot,

For once be every care forgot;

Let gentle peace assert her power,

And kind affection rule the hour.

We're all—all here.

(Adapted from a poem

by Charles Sprague.)

God bless us to strengthen our families by avoiding the crafty designs of

the adversary and following the noble

ways of the Lord, so that in due time

we can report to our Heavenly Father

in his celestial home that we are all

there, father, mother, sister, brother,

all who hold each other dear. Each

chair is filled, we are all back home.

In the name of Jesus Christ.

Amen. o

President Harold B. Lee

Thank you Brother Benson for that

excellent talk and reminder about the

responsibility of the home, and thank

all of you brethren for the excellent

addresses, and you particularly President Smith for the timely and inspiring

keynote talk that you have given to us.

We are grateful to this beautiful

Singing Mothers chorus for furnishing

us with their inspiring music this

morning.

The chorus will now favor us with,

"More Holiness Give Me."

The benediction will then be offered

by Elder Cecil E. Hart, former Regional Representative of the Twelve, after

which this conference will stand adjourned until two o'clock this afternoon.
